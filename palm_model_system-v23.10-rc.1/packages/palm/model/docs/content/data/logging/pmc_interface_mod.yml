  description: |
    For atmosphere-ocean coupling, a smaller grid size in x-direction can be chosen for the ocean, so that the ocean has more grid points along x than the atmosphere. In that case, data must be interpolated from the atmosphere to the ocean grid. Therefore, it must be ensured that each atmosphere grid interval contains the same number of ocean gridpoints. This is ensured only if condition $(nx_o + 1) - INT \left( \frac{nx_o + 1}{nx_a + 1} \right) * (nx_a + 1) = 0$ holds, where $nx_o,  nx_a$ are the number of grid points along $x$ for the ocean and atmosphere model, respectively.
