  message: |
    ocean mode does not allow vertically shifted childs
  description: |
    Nesting in ocean mode (see [ocean parameters namelist](../Namelists/#ocean-parameters)) always requires the child top to match the sea surface. The last entry in [domain_layouts](../Namelists/#nesting_parameters--domain_layouts) must be set to *0.0* for all childs.  

OCM0002:

  message: |
    ocean mode does not allow cyclic-fill initialization
  description: |
    Main runs with [initializing_actions](../Namelists/#initialization_parameters--initializing_actions) = *'cyclic_fill'* cannot use ocean mode so far.

    ocean mode does not allow coupling_char = ... set by palmrun-option "-y"
  description: |
    The `palmrun` option `-y` must not be used for atmosphere runs. The option is only required for ocean precursor runs, which are followed by coupled atmosphere-ocean] restart runs.

  message: |
    use_top_fluxes must be .TRUE. in ocean mode
  description: |
    In ocean mode (see [ocean parameters namelist](../Namelists/#ocean-parameters)), fluxes at the water surface must be prescribed as driving boundary conditions. In atmosphere-ocean coupled runs, these fluxes are provided by the atmosphere run.

    unknown boundary condition: bc_sa_t = "..."
  description: |
    See [bc_sa_t](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--bc_sa_t) for allowed values.

OCM0006:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    salinityflux must not be set for ocean run without salinity
  description: |
    You have set [top_salinityflux](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--top_salinityflux) or/and [bottom_salinityflux](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--bottom_salinityflux) to a non-zero value, and simultaneously switched off the salinity equation. Remove either the flux settings from your namelist file, or set [salinity](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--salinity) = *.TRUE.*.

OCM0007:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    boundary condition: bc_sa_t = "..." requires to set top_salinityflux
  description: |
    You have chosen a Neumann boundary condition for salinity at the top (by setting [bc_sa_t](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--bc_sa_t) = *'neumann'*), but you did not provide a salinity flux at the top. Please provide [top_salinityflux](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--top_salinityflux) in the namelist file.

OCM0008:
  loglevel: ERROR
  message: |
    boundary condition: bc_sa_t = "..." is not allowed with top_salinityflux /= 0.0
  description: |
    You have tried to set both, a Dirichlet boundary condition for salinity at the top (by setting [bc_sa_t](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--bc_sa_t) = *'dirichlet'*), and a salinity flux at the top (with [top_salinityflux](../Namelists/#ocean_parameters--top_salinityflux) /= *0.0*). Please decide, if you like to give either the salinity or the salinity flux as top boundary condition, and omit one of the two parameters in the parameter file.

    wrong settings for stokes_wavelength and/or stokes_waveheight
  description: |
    If you set parameters stokes_wavelength and stokes_waveheight to switch on the Stokes force in ocean mode, they must '''both''' be set > 0.0. Values < 0.0 are not allowed.
